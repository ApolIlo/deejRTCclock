# In this fork

This fork of deej adds remappable button support, an oled display, and a RTC. Buttons must be defined in config with int values. The key values can be found here: https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event/blob/master/keybd_windows.go (make sure to convert hex values to int)

Be sure to visit the [original repository](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

# deej

deej is an **open-source hardware volume mixer** for Windows and Linux PCs. It lets you use real-life sliders (like a DJ!) to **seamlessly control the volumes of different apps** (such as your music player, the game you're playing and your voice chat session) without having to stop what you're doing.

**Join the [deej Discord server](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu) if you need help or have any questions!**
